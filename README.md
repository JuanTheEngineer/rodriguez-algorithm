# My Algorithm
This is my algorithm

## OVERVIEW:
Initially, the goal of this algorithm was to make it possible to
fill a binary tree with ordered data and keep a balance structure.

This goal led to discovering and replicating a sequence that can maps
the process of creating a balanced binary tree.
